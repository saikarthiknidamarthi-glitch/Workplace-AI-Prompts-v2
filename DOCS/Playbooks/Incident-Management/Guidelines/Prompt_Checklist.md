# Prompt Pre-Flight Checklist

Before running any prompt, verify:

1. ✅ All required fields (role, context, date, etc.) are filled.  
2. ✅ Output format is specified (table, JSON, email, etc.).  
3. ✅ Constraints & policies are defined (tone, data rules, limits).  
4. ✅ Scope is limited to one task at a time.  
5. ✅ Max length or sections are set to control verbosity.  
6. ✅ Edge/error cases are specified (fallback instructions).  
7. ✅ Human review required is flagged before final use.

These checks ensure prompts remain robust, auditable, and aligned with industry standards.
