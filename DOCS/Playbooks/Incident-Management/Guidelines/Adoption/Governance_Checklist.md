# Governance Checklist â€“ Workplace-AI-Prompts

Use this checklist to ensure safe and compliant AI adoption:

- [ ] Sensitive outputs require manager approval  
- [ ] Data privacy enforced (no PII/financials in prompts)  
- [ ] Escalation process defined (who approves exceptions)  
- [ ] Version control in place (log updates to prompts/templates)  
- [ ] Training completed by all active users  
- [ ] Feedback mechanism active (weekly or biweekly reviews)

This ensures responsible AI usage and trust inside organizations.
